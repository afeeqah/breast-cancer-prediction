            <h2>Introduction to Breast Cancer</h2>
            <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. It can occur in both men and women, but it is far more common in women. There are several types of breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma, and inflammatory breast cancer.</p>
            <p>Common risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history, genetic mutations (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), hormonal factors (such as early menstruation or late menopause), lifestyle choices (such as alcohol consumption and lack of physical activity), and environmental factors (such as exposure to radiation).</p>
