# Breast Cancer Prediction System

## Description
This system predicts breast cancer using a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** machine learning model. The application is built using **PHP** for the web interface and **Python** for the backend machine learning model. It helps in predicting the likelihood of breast cancer based on input data.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP** for the web interface
- **Python** for machine learning
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** for breast cancer prediction
- **CSS** for styling
- **MySQL** (or any database you're using)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/afeeqah/breast-cancer-prediction.git
    ```
2. Set up the PHP environment (ensure you have a web server like Apache or Nginx).
3. Set up the Python environment (ensure you have all necessary libraries installed, such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, etc.):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the PHP backend and Python model:
    - Start your local PHP server.
    - Run the Python script to train and predict using the MLP model.
5. Use the front-end interface to input data and receive predictions on the likelihood of breast cancer.
